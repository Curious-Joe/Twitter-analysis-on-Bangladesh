Introduction
============

The objective of this analysis was to get an idea about what kind of impression about the country is left in the Twitter.

Objective
=========

To reach the objective three specific goals were set as follows: 1. Around which topics twitter discussions usually circle around, 2. What is the overall sentiment about Bangladesh that is conveyed by the tweets, 3. As an extension of the previous two steps: A topic wise sentiment analysis to reveal what kind of sentiments(s) carried by the generally discussed topics.

Data collection
===============

For that study I used public API that is provided from Twitter for twitter analysis. I fetched total 20,000 random twitter posts that were in English and had a mention of 'Bangladesh'. So I used 'Bangladesh' as the search term and collected total 20,000 twitters using R through the public API of Twitter.

Methodology used
================

For topic modeling Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model was applied and for sentiment analysis lexicon based analysis was conducted with NRC Emotion Lexicon (EmoLex).

Overall finding and discussion
================

From our random walk on the tweets related to Bangladesh, we have seen ‘cricket’ and ‘Rohingya’ were the two areas that people cared most. Overall, people exuded a positive sentiment along with emotions of trust and anticipation. But in case of Rohingya crisis, we showed a mixed sentiment. About Rohingya issue both the positive and negative sentiments were high. Moreover, the emotions also seemed to be mixed. People felt sorry for the Rohingya people but they also expressed fear. So, what could that mean? Were people sympathetic to the plight of Rohingya but also had some share of fear related to the issue? This study doesn’t allow us to conclude on any such conclusion. But it gives us an idea of what we may achieve by having such a walk. Maybe we need to go for a walk with Bangladesh on the online social media sites more often to get a clearer image on what people talk about Bangladesh and what may needs to be improved to leave a better digital footprint for the country.
